## Operations ms c1 c2 
This program is a calculator for basic operation like ("+", "-", "/", "x") in 10 base in size and condition (MS), representation to complement 1 (C1) and representation to complement 2 (C2).

## Rep ms c1 c2
This program convert from a number in base 10 to a number represented in: size and condition (MS), representation to complement 1 (C1) and representation to complement 2 (C2).
